Additionally, a detailed demonstration to the team was conducted, highlighting the intricacies of Live Connection mode.

**Findings:**

1. The Retail Sales Sample dataset, accessed from the Power BI service, provided a practical environment for learning and implementing Power BI development techniques.

2. Successful creation and publication of a Power BI report, potentially incorporating RLS, showcased proficiency in Power BI service utilization and DAX application.

3. The Live Connection mode allowed for real-time insights and interactive exploration of the dataset.

**Challenges:**

1. Ensuring a seamless integration of RLS within the Power BI report, providing controlled access based on user roles.

2. Balancing the depth of explanation during the team demonstration to cover essential aspects without overwhelming the audience.

3. Adapting to the nuances of Power BI service development, particularly in a live connection scenario, ensured optimal performance and user experience.

**Next Steps:**

1. Explored the Retail Sales Sample dataset on the Power BI service.

2. Developed a Power BI report with a focus on incorporating RLS for enhanced security.

3. Planned and executed a comprehensive demonstration to the team, providing insights into the Live Connection mode and the developed report.

By addressing these aspects, the task equipped individuals with practical skills in Power BI service development and DAX usage.
